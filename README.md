# viiksetjs
A lightweight Javascript graphing library for React based on d3

## About

Viikset is the halfway point between visualization libraries with atomic control like d3 and out of the box solutions like recharts or chartjs. Big shout out to Harrision Shoff [@hshoff](https://github.com/hshoff) and the people over at [vx](https://github.com/hshoff/vx) who helped shape the thinking for this type of visualization library.


### Getting started
`npm install viiksetjs`
