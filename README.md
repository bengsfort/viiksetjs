## About

Viikset is the halfway point between visualization libraries with atomic control like d3 and out of the box solutions
like recharts or chartjs. Big shout out to Harrison Shoff [@hshoff](https://github.com/hshoff) and the people over at
[vx](https://github.com/hshoff/vx) who helped shape the thinking for this type of visualization library.

It is meant to serve both those who want a high level of control (see the 'Interop with vx' section) and those who want
to throw together charts quickly with little to no configuration. If you like this library and want to have more
granular control over your chart components, I would strongly suggest checking out the [vx](https://github.com/hshoff/vx)
repo and familiarizing yourself with it, as any vx components can be used in tandem with Viikset.
